# oracle-db-docker
This projects provides Dockerfiles that will build images based on Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.8 with an installation of Oracle Database software for versions 12cR1 and 11gR2.
Theses image can then be used as a base to create your databases.
Before building the images you should download the binary installations files from Oracle website. Alternatively, you can use the images available from my dockerhub:
